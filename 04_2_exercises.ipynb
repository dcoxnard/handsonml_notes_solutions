    "**Which Linear Regression training algorithm can be used on a training set that has millions of features?**\n",
    "\n",
    "An iterative method is needed to train a Linear Regression model on a dataset with millions of features.  This is because the closed-form solution to the OLS problem involves computing the Moooe-Penrose pseudoinverse of the training matrix, $(\\pmb{X}^{\\intercal}\\pmb{X})^{-1}\\pmb{X}^{\\intercal}\\pmb{y}$, which is very computationally inefficient.  Interative methods such a Gradient Descent are more computationally efficient and are guaranteed (under some assumptions) to converge to the global optimum."

    "**Suppose the features in your traning set have very different scales.  Which algorithms might suffer from this, and how?  What can be done to mitigate this effect?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Any machine learning algorithm that makes comparisons between features on the basis of within-feature Euclidean distance implicitly makes the assumption that the scale on which every feature is measured is the same.  Violating this assumption can lead to undersired results, because those features that are measured on larger scales as affected differently from features measured on smaller scales.  This unequal treatment of the features is almost never desired.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, when regularizing a Linear Regression model by penalizing some norm of the weights matrix, features measured on a larger scale will be \"penalized\" more than those measured on a smaller scale, leading to the large-scale features to be more drastically reduced towards zero.  This is undesired because typically the goal of using a regularized model is to reduce the weights of features that do not contribute meaninfgully to the predictive power of the model, regardless of the scale on which the features are measured.\n",
    "\n",
    "Algorithms that can suffer from this effect without a data preprocessing step include Ridge Regression, LASSO, and the Elastic Net.  Each one of these models contains a penalty term that penalizes large weights, and thus each model implicitly makes the assumption that all of the features are measured on the same scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "To preprocess the data to fit the regularization assumption, scaling the features is needed. This will guarantee that the features are measured on the same scale, i.e. with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.  If $\\mu$ is the mean of feature vector $\\pmb{x}$ and $\\sigma$ is its standard deviation, then the preprocessed feature vector $\\tilde{\\pmb{x}}$ is given by: $$ \\tilde{\\pmb{x}} = \\frac{\\pmb{x} - \\mu}{\\sigma} $$.\n",
    "\n",
    "`scikit-learn` implements a `StandardScaler` class that can be used to perform this scaling on all features of an input matrix `X` by calling `X_scaled = StandardScaler().fit_transform(X)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A nuance of model evaluation that is sometimes forgotten is the need to scale any validation by using the same learned parameters (i.e. $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$ for each sclaed feature), and **not** to learn a new set of parameters to scale the validaiton data. Failure to do so is data leakage: data used to validate the model must be assumed to come from the training data's distribution, and thus must be preprocessed using the parameters learned from the training data."

    "**Can Gradient Descent get stuck in a local minimum when training a Logistic Regression model?**\n",
