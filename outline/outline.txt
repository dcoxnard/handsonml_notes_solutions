    - P(A & B)
    - P(A | B)
    - P(~A)
    - Conditional Probability
    - Independence
- Bayes's Rule
- Definitions & theorems for Expected Value and Variance
- What is the difference between an average and expected value?

### Distributions
- Bernouilli
    - Give definition
    - Formula for mean and variance / standard deviation
    - Create a toy example for pencil-paper
    - Create a toy example for Python
    - Bonus would be R and Julia
    - Real-world problem example
- Uniform
- Binomial
- Multinomial
- Exponential
- Poisson
- Gaussian
    - Law of Large Numbers (strong and weak)
    - Central Limit Theorem
    - When is it appropriate to approximate normal
- What rules need to be satisfied by probability distributions?

### Brainteasers

## Statistics
- Definition of population, sample mean
- Definition of population, sample variance and standard deviation
- Definition of covariance, correlation
- A/B Test
- Hypothesis test
    - What kinds are there?
    - Procedure?  Implement in Python
    - Give some toy problems
    - Confidence Intervals
    - How does the hypothesis test for categorical data differ from the hypothesis test for numerical data?
